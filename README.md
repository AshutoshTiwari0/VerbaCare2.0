## Overview
VerbaCare 2.0 is an advanced natural language processing tool designed to detect signs of distress in text. This AI technology works alongside human support systems to identify individuals who may need help, turning words into timely interventions.

## Features
- Utilizes logistic regression and bag-of-words (BoW) for predictions.
- Detects signs of distress in text.
- Integrates with human support systems for timely interventions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
